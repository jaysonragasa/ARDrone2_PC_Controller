# AR.Drone 2 PC Controller
A controller for ARDrone 2.0 written with WPF and C#. Started developing the client app last 2013 and stopped the development last 2015 due to very unfortunate event. *My AR.Drone flew away on its own.*
  
The app is communicating with the drone using AT commands via WiFi and using the [ARDrone-Control-.NET](https://github.com/shtejv/ARDrone-Control-.NET) Library.  
  
I couldn't think of any good HUD design but fortunately, Obvlivion movie was release and now it looks like this. - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9t1IiHYyNo)
